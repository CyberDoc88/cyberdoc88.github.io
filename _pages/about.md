I lead strategic cybersecurity and AI initiatives with a sharp focus on real-world impact, executive alignment, and long-term operational resilience. My background spans public sector missions and enterprise security operations, where Iâ€™ve built threat intelligence programs, supported high-level risk decisions, and driven scalable implementations of emerging technology.

I specialize in translating emerging threatsâ€”particularly those amplified by AIâ€”into coherent strategies and actionable capabilities. From defining zero-to-one threat intel functions to managing $85M+ in cybersecurity-related procurements, my work supports mission readiness in environments where failure isnâ€™t an option.

My leadership style blends technical fluency with executive-level clarity. I bring a grounded, no-hype approach to complex problemsâ€”balancing AI-driven innovation with the strategic controls required to deploy securely and responsibly.

### My Focus

As AI rapidly alters the threat landscape, I remain focused on building systems and strategies that stand up to the velocity and ambiguity of modern adversaries. Whether advising senior decision-makers or designing implementation frameworks, I prioritize clarity, security, and trust at scale.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing opportunities that expand my impactâ€”whether through direct leadership roles (Director, VP, CISO) or fractional engagements where depth and direction are equally critical.
